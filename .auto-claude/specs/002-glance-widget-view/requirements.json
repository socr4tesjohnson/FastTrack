  "task_description": "# Glance/Widget View\n\nCreate a Garmin glance widget that displays current fasting status, elapsed time, and progress percentage without opening the full app. Users can see their fast progress directly from the watch face.\n\n## Rationale\nGlances are the ultimate convenience feature for wearables - faster than even unlocking a phone. This directly addresses the competitor pain point of needing to pull out a phone. A glance check takes under 1 second vs 5-10 seconds for a phone app.\n\n## User Stories\n- As a faster, I want to see my progress from my watch face so that I don't have to open any app\n- As a busy user, I want a 1-second glance at my fasting status so that I can stay informed with minimal interruption\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Glance view shows: fasting status (active/inactive), elapsed time, progress %\n- [ ] Glance updates at least every minute during active fast\n- [ ] Tap on glance opens full app\n- [ ] Glance displays 'Not Fasting' state when no active fast\n- [ ] Visual design consistent with full app styling\n- [ ] Works on devices that support glances\n",
